File Formats
************

This page describes the output file formats produced by ``megalodon``.

------------
Base Calling
------------

Basecalling produces either FASTQ or FASTA formats.
Basecalls will be output into the ``basecalls.fastq`` or ``basecalls.fasta`` file within the ``--output-directory``.

Basecall anchored modified base calls are output into a custom HDF5 format (similar to the guppy output format descibed on the community page).
The HDF5 format contains a single dataset, ``mod_long_names`` at the root level which contains the modified base long names as described in the model used for calling.
The ``Reads`` group contains all of the per-read modified base scores.
Within this group each reads modified base scores are stored in a dataset indexed by the read_id.
This dataset contains an array with dimensions ``basecall length`` by ``number of modified bases``.
Unlike the guppy output, scores are only recorded where applicable given the basecall made (e.g. 5mC calls are only output at canonical C basecall positions).
Invalid positions are represented with a ``NAN`` value.
Note that the modified base scores outside of the dependent canonical contexts are not effected during training, so these values should not be used from the guppy output.

-------
Mapping
-------

Mapped reads can be output in SAM, BAM or CRAM formats.
Basecalls will be output into the ``mappings.sam``, ``mappings.bam``, or ``mappings.cram`` file within the ``--output-directory``.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whatshap Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to standard mapping files, megalodon includes a special mapping-style output with specific relevence to the variant calling pipeline.
This format can be output as a SAM, BAM or CRAM file as with standard mapping format.
The mapped reads in this output represent only the information about proposed variants contained within each read.
Each read is first replaced with the reference bases, with only positions with proposed variants replaced with variants calls.
The score for each call is encoded in the base quality scores for each read.
This output is useful for 1) producing more accuracte variant phasing and read haplotagging via whatshap and 2) visualizing per-read variant calls in a genome browser.

-----------------------
Per-read Modified Bases
-----------------------

~~~~~~~~
Database
~~~~~~~~

The primary output for per-read modified base results is an `sqlite database <https://www.sqlite.org/index.html>`_.
This database contains an indexed table with per-read, per-position, modified base scores, as well as auxiliary tables with read, modification type and reference position information.
The read table (``read``) contains the read UUID.
The modification type table (``mod``) contains the single letter modified base code, the location sequence match motif, the raw (including ambiguous bases) motif, and the relative modified base position within the motifs.
The reference position table (``pos``) contains the mapped 0-based position, strand (1=forward, -1=reverse) and chromosome (via a final ``chrm`` table which contains the chromosome text).

This database may be accessed via the ``megalodon.mods.ModsDb`` object.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tab-delimited
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modified bases results are also available via tab-dellimited text output.
This output can be requested via the ``--write-mods-text`` flag.
This output contains the following fields: ``read_id``, ``chrm``, ``strand``, ``pos``, ``mod_log_prob``, ``can_log_prob``, ``mod_base``, ``motif``

-------------------------
Aggregated Modified Bases
-------------------------

The default aggregated modified base output is the bedMethyl format (`description here <https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/wgbs/>`_).
Alternative formats are `wiggle <https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html>`_ (variableStep) and VCF (treating the modified base as if it were a sequence variant).

--------------------------
Per-read Sequence Variants
--------------------------

As with the modified base results, the primary output for per-read sequence variant results is as `sqlite database <https://www.sqlite.org/index.html>`_.
This database contains an indexed table with per-read, per-position, variant scores, as well as auxiliary tables with read, reference location and alternative allele information.

The reference location table (``loc``) contains the mapped 0-based position, strand (1=forward, -1=reverse) and chromosome (via a final ``chrm`` table which contains the chromosome text).
The ``loc`` table also contains the location for the start and end of the tested positions (applicable for insertions/delections).
For example, insertions generally require a context base for downstream processing, but within megalodon only the inserted position is considered (without context).
Each reference location is linked to the IDs linked with this location from the input variants file.
Finally the reference sequence for the location is included in this table.
In the related ``alt`` table, each alternative sequence is stored.
Links between alternative sequences and reference locations are made via the main ``data`` table.

The ``read`` table contrains the read UUID as well as the mapped strand for each read.

----------------------------
Aggregated Sequence Variants
----------------------------

Sequence variant calls are output in standard VCF format (version 4.1).
The sample format fields includes the following standard VCF fields: ``gt``, ``gq``, ``gp``, ``gl``, and ````pl``
In addition the non-standard ``log_probs`` field, containing the per-read contributions to the variant call, can be added to the VCF file by setting the ``--write-vcf-log-probs`` flag.
